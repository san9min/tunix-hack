    "\n",
    "We adopt LoRA-based SFT as an initial stage to stabilize the model’s reasoning structure. The SFT process is conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the model is trained on general-domain data containing relatively long chains of thought (CoT) to learn reasoning processes. In the second stage, we further fine-tune the model on samples with reasoning lengths of up to 1024 tokens, which is our target length, while slightly increasing the proportion of mathematical reasoning data.\n",

    "\n",
    "We use a domain-routed hybrid reward with a shared format constraint across all domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Math samples receive format + answer correctness rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-math samples receive format + probability-based (RLPR-style) rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule-based Reward $R_{\\text{rule}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a rule-based reward composed of two components:\n",
    "a format reward, which is applied to all domains, and an answer reward, which is only applied to math samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule-based reward for math domain is defined as:\n",
    "$$ R_{rule} = R_{format} + R_{answer} $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Format Reward $R_{\\text{fmt}}$** : This reward is applied to both math and non-math samples, enforcing a strict output contract: `<reasoning> ... </reasoning> <answer> ... </answer>`.A response receives a positive reward only if it strictly matches the required tag template, with no extra text outside the tags, correct tag order, non-empty reasoning and answer spans. Missing tags, malformed structure, strict-match failures, or empty spans receive negative penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Answer Reward $R_{\\text{ans}}$** : ONLY for Math domain. Answer correctness is evaluated using a cascade of increasingly permissive checks:\n",
    "      - Exact string match after normalization (whitespace, currency symbols, commas)\n",
    "      - Numeric parsing for valid numeric forms including integers,floating-point / scientific notation, fractions,percentages\n",
    "      - Ratio-band partial credit when numeric parsing succeeds but values differ, using: $[0.9, 1.1]$, then $[0.8, 1.2]$, with decreasing reward.If direct parsing fails but the ground-truth answer is numeric, we extract the last numeric token from the model output and provide limited partial credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability-based Reward $R_{\\text{prob}}$ (Non-Math)\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-math samples, we compute a policy-confidence signal by measuring the rollout policy’s average probability of the ground-truth answer tokens under teacher forcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y*$ denote the ground-truth answer (optionally wrapped as `<answer>`{y*}`</answer>` and appended with EOS), and let $\\mathcal{Y}$ be the token positions of $y*$.\n",

    "We compute per-token probabilities under the rollout policy $\\pi$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{\\text{full}}= \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{Y}|}\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{Y}} \\exp\\!\\left(\\log p_{\\pi}\\left(y_t^{*}\\mid\\text{prompt} + \\text{reasoning},y_{<t}^{*}\\right)\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debiasing**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Std-based Prompt Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "When sampling $G$ rollouts per prompt, we compute the per-prompt standard deviation of $R_{\\text{prob}}$.\n",
    "Prompts with standard deviation below a threshold $\\beta$ (fixed or EMA-updated) are filtered by zeroing out their $R_{\\text{prob}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final reward combines a **shared format reward** with a\n",
    "**domain-specific learning signal** (answer correctness for math, probability for non-math):\n",
    "\n",
    "For each sample $i$, the final reward is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_i=\\begin{cases}\\lambda_{\\text{rule}} \\, R_{\\text{rule}, i},& \\text{if } d_i = \\text{math}, \\\\[6pt]\\lambda_{\\text{prob}} \\, R_{\\text{prob}, i}+\\lambda_{\\text{fmt}} \\, R_{\\text{fmt}, i},& \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}$$\n",

Glaiveai supplies large-scale general-domain reasoning traces beyond math and code, while Bespoke complements it with high-quality, correctness-filtered reasoning data across math, code, science, and logic tasks.\n",

Specifically, we sample reasoning traces using a 1:4 ratio between long and short CoT examples, aiming to balance exposure to rich reasoning processes—such as self-correction and verification patterns typically found in long CoTs—with shorter reasoning traces that are more learnable for small models.\n",

    "## 💡 Lesson Learned\n",
    "**CoT Length**\n",
    "\n",
    "Long chain-of-thought (CoT) data naturally encode advanced reasoning behaviors—self-reflection, verification, and dynamic strategy adaptation—that are typically absent from short CoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for small models (at least in the LoRA-based SFT setting with a ~20k dataset), long CoTs are difficult to learn effectively. We observe that the model tends to overthink even on easy problems (e.g., GSM8K), producing unnecessarily long reasoning traces and still arriving at incorrect answers. On such easy tasks, short CoT training often performs better, yielding more stable and accurate solutions. At the same time, training only on short CoT limits the model’s reasoning capacity: it fails to acquire the higher-order abilities that long CoT enables, such as extended planning and iterative verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, mixing long and short CoT in an appropriate ratio appears crucial during SFT as a pre-training stage for subsequent RL. Short CoT helps anchor correctness and efficiency on simple tasks, while long CoT exposes the model to richer reasoning patterns that can be further amplified and refined during RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Domain Ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "Verifiable data provides stable anchors for correctness, while non-verifiable data enables broad general reasoning. We aim to maximize the proportion of general-domain data while maintaining (or at least not degrading) basic mathematical ability, even if improvements are only marginal. In this stage, enforcing a stable reasoning format is also critical. We therefore tune the dataset mixture by monitoring GSM8K accuracy as a proxy for core math competence and format accuracy to ensure consistent adherence to the required output structure in the SFT stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make Reasoning Consice and Compact**\n",
    "\n",
    "Concise and compact reasoning does not emerge from aggressive truncation alone.\n",
    "Instead, it arises from a staged process in which the model is first exposed to rich reasoning behaviors, then further learn more at learnable reasoning lengths, and finally optimized under strict generation constraints, together with verified rewards, implicitly favor efficient reasoning by encouraging correctness within limited generation budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "💬 **Comment**\n",
    "- The integration with Weights & Biases (W&B) made experiment tracking and iteration straightforward and convenient.\n",
    "- Tighter integration with standard LLM benchmarks would be highly beneficial, making the framework a much stronger post-training solution.\n",
    "- Accessing TPUs required long wait times, which significantly slowed down experimentation."
